# Morse Code Program
## 🍼 Introduction:  
This project is about creating a morse code translator which takes an input of plain English and converts it visually in morse code.  
The conversion into visual morse code is then used to translate it into sound using the system bell.    

## 🥊 Main Commits:
1. Working program in Python converting into morse code and plays correct sound. - 27/11/2021  
2. Adding whitespace as key and value in dictionary. Allowing multiple words to be converted with spaces. - 27/11/2021  
3. Error handling included for numbers and special characters. - 28/11/2021  

## 🚀 To-do:
🔨 Create a GUI to encase code    
🔨 Create feature converting morse code back into plain English  
🔨 (More ideas in the making)
